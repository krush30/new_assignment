# New Assignment Project

This project demonstrates a full-stack application with authentication using JWT for user registration and login. After successful login, users can access the dashboard where they can enter their name and date of birth (DOB). The application calculates the user's age based on the provided DOB.

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: JWT is used for secure user registration and login.
- **Frontend**: Built with React and Redux for state management.
- **Backend**: Developed using Express and Node.js.
- **Validation**: All errors are properly validated and handled with correct HTTP status responses.
- **API Testing**: The backend can be tested using Postman.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krush30/new_assignment.git


## Installation and Usage

### Install Backend Dependencies

### To Run Only the Backend (for API Testing in Postman)
npm run start-backend
